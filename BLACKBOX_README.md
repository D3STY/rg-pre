## Introduction

RG-pre is a collection of shell scripts that can be used to automate the process of pre-releasing files on a Usenet server. 

## Prerequisites

Before using RG-pre, you will need to have the following installed:

* A Linux server with SSH access
* A FTP server with a pre-release directory
* A text editor
* A command-line FTP client

## Installation

To install RG-pre, simply clone the repository to your server:

```
git clone https://github.com/RG-pre/rg-pre.git
```

## Configuration

Once RG-pre is installed, you will need to configure it. The configuration file is located at `/etc/rg-pre.conf`.

The configuration file contains the following settings:

* `logpath`: The path to the log file.
* `sitename`: The name of your Usenet server.
* `glftpd_conf`: The path to the glftpd configuration file.
* `base_pre_path`: The path to the pre-release directory.
* `datapath`: The path to the data directory.
* `date_0day_format`: The date format for 0day releases.
* `date_mp3_format`: The date format for MP3 releases.
* `date_mv_format`: The date format for MVID releases.
* `section_names`: The names of the pre-release sections.
* `target_paths`: The paths to the pre-release sections.
* `script_paths`: The paths to the scripts that return pre-release information.
* `allowdefaultsection`: Whether or not to allow the "SITE PRE <dirname>" command.
* `defaultsection`: The number of the default pre-release section.

## Usage

To use RG-pre, simply FTP into your server and run the following command:

```
site pre <dirname> <section>
```

Where:

* `<dirname>` is the name of the directory that you want to pre-release.
* `<section>` is the name of the pre-release section that you want to pre-release to.

For example, to pre-release the directory `/home/user/releases/mp3/album` to the MP3 section, you would run the following command:
