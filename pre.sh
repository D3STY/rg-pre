#
# Notes:
# 1) Make sure that all pre dir names are exactly the same as the
#    group names they are linked to.
# 2) The following bins are required in glftpd's bin dir:
#    sed, echo, touch, chmod, pwd, grep, basename, date, mv, bash,
#    dupediradd, find
# 3) If you don't have it already compiled in your glftpd's bin dir,
#    you must compile glftpd/bin/sources/dupediradd.c as
#    gfltpd/bin/dupediradd, then chmod 666 ftp-data/logs/dupelog
#    and chmod 666 ftp-data/logs/glftpd.log so they can be written
#    to by all users when they pre.
# 4) Make sure glftpd/dev/null is world writable or you will
#    get strange errors.
# 5) All paths specified in the configuration section of this script
#    should be chrooted to glftpd dir. In other words, you specify
#    /ftp-data and not /glftpd/ftp-data or /jail/glftpd/ftp-data.
